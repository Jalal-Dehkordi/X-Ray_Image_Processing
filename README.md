# X-Ray_Image_Processing
# Image Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains Python code for various image processing tasks using OpenCV and NumPy. The code showcases techniques such as thresholding, color channel separation, edge detection, and histogram analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)

### Installation Steps
Install the required libraries using pip:

## Usage

- **Reading and Thresholding Images**: Read a grayscale image and apply thresholding to segment based on skin and muscle tones.
  
- **Color Channel Separation**: Isolate the Red, Green, and Blue channels from an RGB image.
  
- **Edge Detection**: Apply edge detection using Laplacian filter and Sobel operator.
  
- **Histogram Analysis**: Analyze the histogram of grayscale images.
